## Takeaways

I used this project as an opportunity to explore ClojureScript and functional programming concepts. My first big takeaway is that functional programming is beautiful in its brevity, there were a couple of moments during the development process where I was blown away with how little I actually had to write to solve a problem. 

I also really enjoyed the hiccup syntax for similar reasons. I was able to create a useful front end without having to worry about closing tags which was great!
